    <div class="info-box">What is Brow Lamination?
        Brow lamination is a beauty treatment that smooths and lifts your natural 
        brow hairs to give them a fuller, more defined look. Think of it like a perm 
        for your eyebrows—your brow hairs are brushed into place and set with a gentle 
        solution so they stay styled and sleek. The lamination can last up to 6-8 weeks. 
        It’s especially great for taming unruly brows or filling in sparse areas without 
        needing daily gels or pencils

    <div class="info-box">What is Brow Tint?
        Brow Tinting is a quick, painless treatment that enhances your natural brows by adding
         semi-permanent color to the hairs. It helps define your shape, darken lighter hairs, 
         and create the look of fuller, more polished brows—no makeup needed. Results typically 
         last up to four weeks and are perfect for anyone wanting a low-maintenance beauty routine.
